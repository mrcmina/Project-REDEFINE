This folder contains tools, scripts and data to analyze LANDIS-II outputs and analyze the landscape as a functional network. 

Tools were built by **Nuria Aquilué** for the paper Aquilué, N., Filotas, É., Craven, D., Fortin, M.‐J., Brotons, L., and Messier, C.. 2020. Evaluating forest resilience to global threats using functional response traits and network properties. _Ecological Applications_ 00( 00):e02095.
