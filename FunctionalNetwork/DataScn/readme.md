# Description of contents

This is the folder in which all .Rdata and .txt files with properties of nodes and links of the network *for each scenario, RCM and time step* are saved by running the R scripts n.21 and 22. 

The latest simulations for the paper `Mina_et_al (under review) Network analysis can guide resilience-based management in forest landscapes under global change` were run on early April 2020. Output files not uploaded for matter of space (63.000+ files, 4.03 Gb).
