Description of contents 
---
This folder contains input files to run LANDIS-II with PnET-Succession in the Centre-du-Quebec landscape.

The files are structured in folders and template files because they are made to be run through an R script, that allows running LANDIS in sequence and overwriting file paths based on different climate and management scenarios.
